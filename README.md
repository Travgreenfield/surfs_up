## Report

### Statistical Findings

We can help alleviate some of W. Avy's concern over a repeat of his previous venture's failure by recommending the new surf shop be opened in June where the average rainfall is much less than that of December. Additionally (and probably unsurprising given Hawaii's location in the northern hemisphere), June offers higher temperatures which can continue to drive business. 

The standard deviation is also higher in December for both temperatures and precipitation, indicating more uncertainty and inconsistency. Particularly at launch, being more sure of ideal weather will help the business start strongly and build momentum.

### Future Analysis

- One analysis that could prove useful here is travel information for the months in question. While June's weather is likely considered more ideal for travelers to Hawaii, other factors like price could drive consumers in months where the weather isn't quite as good (as in December). Depending on the differences between the two months, it may be worth altering the strategy.

- Similarly, consumer information can go a long way in helping build a strategy. For example, in what months are customers more likely to purchase ice cream or pick up surfing?

- Lastly, we have the ability to leverage our business partner's knowledge of surfing to match the accompanying data with ideal surfing weather. By doing so, we can pinpoint which months have the most number of days with ideal surfing weather -- possibly altering the way the business is choosing to open and operate.
